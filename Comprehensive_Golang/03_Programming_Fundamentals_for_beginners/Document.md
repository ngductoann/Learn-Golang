## Concept

- Declare: Declare a variable to hold a **VALUE** of a certain **TYPE**. Example: var x int.
- Assign: Assign a value to a variable. Example: var x int = 42.
- Initialize: declare and assign. Assign an **initial** value to a variable.
- Identifier: the name of a variable. Example: x, fName.
- Keywords: These are words that are reserved for use by the Go programming language:
  - They are sometimes called "reserved words"
  - you can't use a keyword for anything other than its purpose
  - [Golang keyword](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Keywords)
- Operator:
  - Is "2+2" the "+" is the OPERATOR
  - An operator is a character that represents an action, as for example "+" is an arthmetic OPERATOR that represents addition.
- Statement:
  - The smallest standalone element of a program that expresses some action to be carry out. It is an instruction that commands the computer to perform a specified action
  - A program is formed by a sequence of one or more statements
  - Example: x := 2 + 7
- Expression:
  - A value, or operators (operands and operators) that express a value.
  - A combination of one or more explicit values, constants, variables, operators, and functions that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another value. For example, 2+7 is an expression which evaluates to 9. For example, 42 is an expression as it's a value.
- Scope:
  - Where a variable exists and is accessible.
  - Best practice: keep score as "narrow" as possible.
