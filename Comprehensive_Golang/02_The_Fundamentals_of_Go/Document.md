## Value and Type

- Go is statically typed, not dynamic
- A **VARIABLE** holds a **VALUE** of specific **TYPE**
- You can't have unused variables in your code
- This is "code pollution"
- The compiler doesn't allow it

## Zero values

- false - boolean
- 0 - int
- 0.0 - float
- "" - string
- nil - pointers, functions, interfaces, slices, channels, maps
